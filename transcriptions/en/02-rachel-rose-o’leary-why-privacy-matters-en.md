_**Doug:**_ Next up is Rachel O’Leary. She here? All right! Good, good, good! Yeah without further ado, Rachel if you want to come up, so the first talk essentially was kind of around “why liberty matters”, that was the idea. This is “why privacy matters”. Obviously it’s going to go into why liberty matters as well, and essentially why, why decentralized currencies matter. And Rachel will express that much more eloquently actually than I can. She is very inspiring when she speaks, and you will experience that right now.

_**Rachel:**_ Hello everyone, thank you so much for coming. Give me one minute to set up here.

_**Doug:**_ Guys, whoa, hey, all right we’re good. While she sets up, just wanna, you know, thank everybody again for coming. Thank everybody, that’s been helping us along the way. We have people, random people, internet friends that have reached out, that are helping us, as I’m sure you can see, everybody’s like scuffling around here. So it’s just amazing that, you know, that happens in the Monero community. People are always willing to lead a lending hand towards, you know, working towards this common goal of spreading the idea of digital cash. So it’s beautiful to see on the internet obviously through the form of the protocol, but it’s also beautiful to see in reality, in person, when people come together and make it happen. Rachel, thank you so much.

_**Rachel:**_ Thank you so much. You guys can hear me okay. Amazing to be here, so many people that I knew online, but I’ve never met in person, so it’s really nice to have this, this get together. And someone here reminded me that the Monero community hasn’t had a significant meet up for a number of years. So it’s great to see everyone.

So I’m Rachel-Rose O’Leary, my friends call me Rose. And I’m a programmer with a philosophy background, and I work on a project called DarkFi which I will discuss a little bit later on. But first I want to tell you a little story which is about the place where I’m from.

So I’m from Ireland, and some thousands of years ago the island of Ireland was covered in trees, a dense forest which was, the type of which was called a Celtic Rainforest. And these forests were the center of Irish society. And so that’s where the houses were built, they were built around the trees, and the forests shaped the Irish language, and the culture, and the spirituality kind of radiated out from the forests. During the process of British colonization the forests were systematically cleared. This event which occurred over the course of a couple centuries had an enormous significance for Irish resistance against the colonial forces. So having the forest cleared meant that the guerilla resistance, which was resided, there was exposed. So they lacked the tree coverage, which enabled them to coordinate and to launch sabotage, and ambush attacks. So having cleared the forests and the defeat of the Irish resistance was accelerated, and the process of colonization was completed. This process eventually turns the Irish landscape into a kind of agricultural backwater for the British empire.

So they having cleared the forests and converted much of the land into farm, potato farms. And this kind of desertification of the Irish landscape corresponded with a tendency towards a more centralized government in the form of the British empire. And later an Irish government, which mirrored the same system as England had had before them, and it also gave way to a very oppressive form of monotheism, that emerged a shift away from the more polytheistic tendencies of the forest society that had existed before. And more recently a new kind of desert has emerged, which is the kind of desert of globalization, where a lot of Irish identity has been worn away. You can change slides.

So historically these kind of diverse geographies, places like forests, like mountains, like cliffs or jungles, have given ways to, have given way to forms of political organizing, which are more decentralized inherently. So contemporary examples of these kind of struggles of an autonomous people against an empire, which you know is historically more closely connected to flatlands and deserts, where we see centralization is more likely to occur, contemporary examples include the Kurds in the mountains of Kurdistan, the Tigris in Ethiopia, and the Zapatistas in Mexico. These are all autonomous peoples, which come from mountain areas with a decentralized politics, a pluralistic mindset, and who are at war with the forces of centralization authoritarianism that are more closely associated with desert flatlands. Change slides.

Yeah, so I see an analog between this duality of the forest and the desert in the war, the digital war between encryption and surveillance. So encryption is a forest, it protects its inhabitants and it provides sanctuary for those who are persecuted, and it provides a critical line of defense. Surveillance on the other hand is a desert. It’s a force of homogenization that turns everything within it into the mimicry of the same static thing.

So privacy, I was asked to talk about the importance of privacy, and here’s what I think the importance of privacy is, privacy, encryption, the digital forest enables us to establish autonomous territories in cyberspace. So this is the dream of the crypto anarchists, and they spoke about building carving out dark spaces on the internet. That were impenetrable by law enforcement and the forces of coercion that they represent. It’s also the dream of the agarists, who spoke about building autonomous economies, counter economies they were called, that existed alongside parallel to but distinct from state-based economies that were like inherently instructive and centralized.

So this is what I see the current situation that we have. There is a feedback loop between anonymity and surveillance, whereby these two tendencies are developing in tandem with each other. The more extreme and oppressive surveillance becomes, the more advanced anonymity techniques must be in order to overcome the encroachment of surveillance. So this means we have the parallel development of extreme surveillance with extreme anonymity. This part, these two parallel processes to me implies that there will be a split in the digital world between spaces which are surveilled and oppressed and spaces which are encrypted and autonomous. I call this RegFi, regulated finance, and DarkFi, dark finance, of which Monero is a part of DarkFi.

So DarkFi is not just you know this phenomena of a anonymous underworld, breaking away from a surveillance-based regime. It’s also the name of a project, which I’m working on with many others, and we’re building anonymous smart contracts geared towards the Monero community. And so it’s free software, we use a GPL license, and we believe in empowering developers as opposed to enslaving them. So a big part of what we do is providing flexible toolkits for developers to deploy in order to create any kind of anonymous application. So we really want to empower developers and we believe in the ability of programmability to lead to massive innovation when it comes to that application design. We’re also built in line with the UNIX philosophy. So we have a simplicity orientated approach. And I encourage you all to check out our repo on GitHub, darkrenaissance/darkfi. So we’re in the early stages, we have a prototype, we’re very close to testnet, and then we will deploy a mainet soon. But the idea is Monero community can use these tools to use or to deploy applications, such as anonymous swaps between different currencies, decentralized anonymous organizations, multi-chain anonymous bridges between different chains, information black markets, and the list goes on, there’s many exciting, it’s a whole new design place of anonymous design that hasn’t been explored. So we’re trying to blow that door wide open for developers.

I want to talk a bit about my own love for Monero, because I really love Monero. I’ve been in love with Monero since around 2017, and I worked for Coindesk around that time, and I showed my bias, my love for Monero, and a lot of articles I wrote where I was trying to defend Monero against flood and fake news attacks by other blockchains and, you know, on the front lines of the media, trying to defend Monero. I love Monero so much that I actually have a Monero tattoo on my heart, it says XMR I’m really into, I love Monero. And the reason why I love Monero is, there’s a few reasons, so one is that it’s a genuinely grassroots community. So it was a fair launch which is beautiful. It was abandoned by its original creator and adopted by the community, you know, much like Bitcoin was. And as well as that Monero has genuinely grassroots network effect among, you know, these critical use cases, such as DarkNet markets. And also many freedom fighter activist friends of mine, who are not in crypto, use Monero. They don't use ZCash as the privacy coin, they have some kind of intuitive distrust of ZCash, but they use Monero. So I think that’s really bullish for Monero. They don’t know anything about crypto, but they know that Monero is what they should use to protect their transactions. That’s very bullish. And I also love Monero because of the community. And I’ve researched this okay. So Monero has the most ideological, philosophical community in the whole of crypto. There is no other community in crypto that puts its political line at the forefront of its work. So that’s been a deep inspiration for me and part of the reason why I’ve loved Monero for so long.

I also love Monero because historically Monero has proven adaptability and that’s, some friends arrived, that’s amazing. And it’s really important for privacy coin. Because we have this co-development of anonymity with surveillance techniques, privacy coins must adapt and evolve as surveillance becomes increasingly hostile. So I have faith in the Monero community, in their ability to adapt to these evolving environments.

With that said, you know, I would like to draw attention to one drawback of the current Monero implementation which is ring signatures. So ring signatures have an important constraint which is that they have what’s called linear running time. You can see that here on the slides it’s represented by this “O” and then “n”, that means linear running time. So linear running time means that if you have a ring size of 11 as we do now, we’re getting an upgrade to 16 pretty soon but let’s go with 11 for now, and if you have a ring size of 11 and that defines first your anonymity set, and if you for example decided that anonymity set was no longer sufficient for a state level adversary, then you could say: “Okay, let’s double the ring size”. However, due to this property of ring signatures, this linear property, if you double the ring size you also double the running time, the compute time of the transaction. So that’s a restriction. It defines a cap of the possible anonymity provided by ring signatures.

zk-SNARKs on the other hand have an interesting property, they’re logarithmic. And so what does that mean? In zk-SNARKs the anonymity set is defined by the height of the Merkle tree. So in DarkFi we have an anonymity set of 2 to the power of 32, 32 being the height of the Merkle tree. So if I wanted to double the anonymity set, I would just do a small change to the circuit which would require a hardfork, and to change that Merkle tree size to 2 to the power of 33. So the increase, as opposed to being a doubling, is a logarithmic increase from 2 to the power of 32 to 2 to the power of 33. And so it’s relatively much smaller then the ring signature increase would require. I will note that historically Monero community have rejected zk-SNARKs based on its use of the trusted setup. And I think that this was the correct approach, and the zk-SNARKs in the early days you were right to not trust them and to reject the trusted setup. However nowadays it is possible to do zk-SNARKs without a trusted setup. And DarkFi is doing that, we use Halo 2, there’s no trusted setup. So Monero community, you are our comrades, we want to work together with you and anything you need to, you know, think about moving away from ring signatures. We will provide you anything you need: research, developers, conversations, we can do that. Okay, next slide, please.

So why are we working, why are we doing this and what is the vision? So I call it “neo-cypherpunk”. Neo-cypherpunk draws on the heroic legacy of the cypherpunks and the crypto anarchists who came before us. It draws on this heroic legacy, but it also tries to think what were the drawbacks of the original cypherpunk vision, and what are the ways that we can update this vision for the contemporary world. So one possible drawback that I see of the old school cypherpunk vision was the emphasis on personal liberty. So personal liberty is really important, don’t get me wrong. However, if we truly want to encounter state-level surveillance, we need to act as a collective. So neo-cypherpunk shifts the focus away from personal liberation to collective or society scale liberation. That’s the goal. The second difference between the old-school cyberpunk and the neo-cypherpunk is its conception of freedom, its definition of freedom. So traditional libertarianism and old-school cyberpunk define freedom as a negative. So freedom is seen as freedom from coercion. And again you know that’s part of freedom, however, I believe we should seek to define freedom in a positive sense. And so the positive definition that I would offer for freedom is freedom of self-determination. And when applied to the kind of former statement I made regarding collective liberation, this becomes freedom of society, societal scale self-determination. And I believe it is anonymity that allows us to achieve this.

This is our manifesto on our website, and I encourage everyone to check it out. On the website you will also find links to our GitHub and our chat which is on Matrix right now, although we’ve made our own peer-to-peer IRC implementation, so we’re going to shift to that pretty soon, but I welcome you all to join and discuss these topics for me. Thank you so much.

_**Doug:**_ You guys, have any questions, anybody want to throw a question out there? All right, hold on. Let’s use a guess.

_**Audience:**_ I was just wondering if zk-SNARKs implementation would decrease the usage on a one CPU, like would it change it to be a compatible with ASIC… Okay that’s all I need to know.

_**Doug:**_ I think we have another. I need mic up there.

_**Audience:**_ Rachel, amazing talk. You brought up the fact that to kind of win this battle for privacy, because it is a constant battle, we have to always evolve and change. There’s a conference going on down the block, where they pride themselves essentially in staying stagnant and not changing. They see that as an ideal that the protocol essentially will never change. What is your take on that?

_**Rachel:**_ Thank you so much. I’ll just quickly give my response which is that. No, no it wouldn’t require ASICs. It might actually be cheaper to run than right signatures it probably would be. So you could run on GPU, CPU.

Regard for your question. This is why I brought up adaptability in the slides. Because especially for privacy coins, but also for all coins you have to retain the ability to update your source code. I think the issue with Bitcoin, to be perfectly honest, is there has been a two kind of parallel developments. One is that the developer class has basically become ossified, and complacent, and comfortable. You know they all did well off of their Bitcoin, they have no incentive to innovate, so they’re essentially squatting the hierarchy of Bitcoin and making the source code is basically rotting under their eyes. And at the same time you also have the kind of popular narratives within Monero, oh sorry within Bitcoin, not Monero, evolving towards, you know, as you said this whole kind of value of “let’s not change the code base ever”. And I think that’s coming from non-programmers who are coming at it from a purely economic perspective. They’re like: we want a stable store value, we don’t want to disrupt it with any hardforks which is like fair enough. But as programmers we know that you cannot keep code exactly the same forever, because there is a phenomena called “code rush” where the code will just disintegrate and become more complex over time, which is what we’re already seeing with Bitcoin. It’s reached the point where other programmers, new programmers cannot properly use it or make changes, because it’s beyond them. And in the early days, you know, there was efforts also by co-founder of DarkFi Amir Taaki to make changes to the Bitcoin protocol, to clean up the source code. He wrote Bitcoin, which is the most efficient Bitcoin implementation, but these were broadly rejected by the Bitcoin community as being too high risk.

_**Doug:**_ Yeah guys, she’s Amir Taaki, raise your head if you guys heard that name before, all right. Amazing that a lot of people haven’t right. I mean this guy, he’s one of the guys who is talking about the importance of crypto being resistant to state influence. From the early days he’s one of the guys that really understood what it’s main purpose was and is, and so I encourage you guys to, you know, do a little googling, watch some of his videos. Go ahead, you have a question? Amir Taaki…

_[NO SOUND]_

_**Rachel:**_
…right the direct evolution of the original Dark Wallet project where it was originally Coinjoin, but then, you know, the alpha was made, the beta I think, and then some time later Amir came back to was like okay realizing Coinjoin is broken. Basically Coinjoin suffers from a linkability problem, the same issue as ring signatures, except for Coinjoin is even worse. The current most popular implementation of Coinjoin is Samurai Wallet. They have anonymity set of 5. So compare that to Monero where you have an anonymity set of 11 plus you’re having a hardwork soon that’s only 16, you can see it’s much better.

_**Doug:**_ So we got Seraphis too coming up. I don’t know if you’re familiar with that.

_**Rachel:**_ I had a little a little introduction, but yes, so Dark Wallet was Coinjoin and then over the years Amir he did implementations of all the major crypto algorithms, including ring signatures, and eventually came to zk-SNARKs as being the most robustly anonymous and the most flexible anonymity technique today. So that’s the one that DarkFi is using for its anonymous payments and has a Zk-VM, where you contracts to like to in zero knowledge.

_**Doug:**_ I’m gonna keep asking you questions, if you don’t mind, because somehow we caught up on time, even though we started late, which is amazing and awesome. I don’t know what we just did we kind of we bent the universe there. And just to say, you know, Seraphis so we have koe who’s coming up, he is like the main guy behind the Seraphis implementation in Monero. It’s amazing that he’s going to be here speaking today guys. I mean that’s just insane. And then we also have Sarang, the other major big brains behind these cryptographic concepts. So just to put that out there, the points that you were making with ring signatures, yes we’ll be touching that on that more, but the what you need to realize is ring signatures is one component of Monero right. We have confidential transactions which you know obfuscate the amounts, nobody’s breaking that uh as far as we know, we have stealth addresses so you don’t know, you know, who you’re sending, you’re, you know, nobody can see who the Monero, who’s receiving the Monero. So that’s an important thing to remember when people criticize ring signatures, realize that’s only one component, and that’s obfuscating who the sender is, and that’s always evolving and getting better. So just an important note to make there.

So what is your take then on Bitcoin, where do you, what role do you see it playing? Do you think ultimately it’s just going to embrace the fact that it is fundamentally transparent at the protocol level and be useful for those purposes or will it eventually, you know, achieve something that Monero is achieving as digital cash?

_**Rachel:**_ I think well I think it’s unlikely. We saw how Taproot would like took years to get in even after it was finished the implementation. And Taproot was a fairly minor and significant change. So I think it’s fairly unlikely that Bitcoin will adopt you know zk-SNARKs or you know something that will make it properly anonymous. However it depends very much on the core developers themselves. In Bitcoin and in crypto projects in general the power base is often obstricated. So you have this developer class at the center, who are making critical decisions about the like life cycle of the protocol that they’re working on. And both you know they often deflect that power you know, they don’t want to be seen to have it, but they do, they’re the ones calling the shots. And we saw this with the Bitcoin scaling debate, where there was an attempt to takeover by the business class inside of Bitcoin. And the core developers showed that they were the ones who controlled the user base effectively. They were the ones who had the soft power to influence the kind of uprising on the network, which pushed out the business class. And so you had the Bitcoin Cash, and that was the illegitimate coin, and then you have Bitcoin itself, was the coin where the developers were, that the core developers were. And so they have this really important role of defining what is the legitimate coin. So if the Bitcoin core developers decided, that they were going to do that and they were like seriously going to do that, and then it would possibly be something that happened. But I don’t think that they will for two reasons: they’re not properly… developers should be constantly training the next generation of developers which is going to supersede them, otherwise you end up with this ossified class and no upward mobility in the protocol. So Bitcoin they’re not putting it necessary effort to training the next generation of developers, and developers that they do have, all due respect to them, have no incentive to innovate. So I don’t see privacy being added to Bitcoin anytime soon.

_**Doug:**_ Yeah, like I mentioned before, confidential transactions, I mean that was developed by…

_**Rachel:**_ Gregory Maxwell.

_**Doug:**_ …Gregory Maxwell. Bitcoin developers. But they have yet to implement it and it doesn’t, they’re not, that’s not happening right. I mean they’re, right, you don’t think that’s gonna. So do you think it’s that privacy needs to fundamentally be built into the core protocol or do you think there are ways to do what Bitcoin is trying to do, which is basically obfuscate on the second layer?

_**Rachel:**_ Yeah, I think you can do that second choice, like for example on Ethereum. I think the, you know, the form of privacy on that, I’m using a lot, is, and I actually used it to anonymize my entry into Monero, which I really liked, was the zk.money. And so that’s a layer two made by aztec which is on it, and you can basically put your ETH onto the layer two, they use zk-SNARKs, then to like break the link, they mint you a new coin, basically on the layer two, that you can withdraw to the layer one. And you end up with this freshly minted like clean ETH on whatever ETH address you send it to. And you can use that ETH then, it’s very cheap, it costs barely nothing, because it’s on the layer two. It takes six hours though ish. So you have to have time, but you can use that ETH, for example, I used it on a Cake Wallet to buy Monero. So that’s a really nice clean entry to Monero.

_**Doug:**_ Good luck, Monero, good luck.

_**Rachel:**_ So that’s an example of one of the best anonymity techniques existing on the layer two today. And however yeah, and I do think there’s a place for that, however you’re obviously sacrificing a lot if you’re only relying on the layer two for privacy. And as we know in Monero the more people who are using your network for privacy, the more anonymous it is. So it’s better, I believe, it’s better to aggregate all your users onto anonymous layer one, rather than splitting up your user base between the fragmented layer twos. However we do have like DarkFi is a layer one, it has its own blockchain. So we’re biased in the sense that we think layer ones are the best way to capture the value created by a network. So we’re biased towards the layer one implementations for that reason.

_**Doug:**_ Yeah I think what Bitcoiners would say there is: “Well, that sounds great in theory”, but they’re concerned about auditability. And we’re gonna cover that as well, we have Sarang that’s going to be covering that topic. That’s always kind of one of the ultimate arguments that comes up against Monero, and we’ll cover that. Do you have an opinion there on kind of that philosophical question old, because that’s ultimately what it becomes?

_**Rachel:**_ I mean it is useful for some things like for example ZCash. They have this issue of not being able to audit their supply. And that’s an issue, because they have a trusted setup where if someone was to have the toxic waste, like the thing that you’re not supposed to have, that’s split between, when you do a trusted set of split between whoever participated, it’s like if they were to collude they could create like a secret, which would allow them to mint new coins on the network. So there’s no way to actually check if that’s happened, because they can’t audit the supply. So that’s an issue in some ways, but it’s not an issue that like I’m particularly worried about. I still think anonymities is more important than optional auditability.

_**Doug:**_ Awesome. I guess another thing that Bitcoiners would say is: “Well, the fact that Monero is so private makes it a target of governments, you know”, some big pointers have said right. Some would, you know, wouldn’t go down that road, they want to, you know, sell the cypherpunk ideal without really being too cypherpunk anymore. But others would straight up say and admit like: “Well, you know, Monero it sounds great once again in theory, but if exchanges aren’t listing it, if you know governments are after it, it’s not going to have liquidity, it’s difficult to get because, you know, people are threatened by it”. What’s your take on that as to, I guess, one: do you think ultimately it is threatened by that, and two: people who are staying away from it because of that?

_**Rachel:**_ I think the kind of situation that you outlined, where like the governments are concerned and cracking down. I think in a roundabout way this is a good thing, like this is good for Monero. It emboldens Monero, it radicalizes this, and it reinforces its autonomy as something distinct, which is outside this, you know, state-based, surveillance-based regime. And so I think that the tension between the anonymous world and the non-anonymous world is good and necessary, and should accelerate. And I think that it’s part of how an anonymous crypto achieves itself determination and autonomy. It’s part of how it manages to articulate its own values, which are distinct from the values of like the current system. And so I think it’s really good, and yeah I mean there is the kind of risk that, like you said, that some people will be like: “Oh, if it’s autonomous and if it’s like outside the surveillance system, I don’t want to partake”. And that’s fair enough, you know, like they want to be in the regulated environment. But I think that over time, as what we call DarkFi is like the anonymous side of crypto and becomes more powerful, there will be a shift from one side to the other.

Also I forgot to mention in my talk, I have this theory what’s called the “regulation trap”. So the regulation trap is basically the more restrictive and oppressive governments become in their attitude to crypto, more effort they invest in trying to crack down on us, the more crypto is essentially justified. And so you have this like increasing oppression, and with it an increasing migration to the anonymous side of crypto. And so by trying to crack down they’re actually magnifying the problem. And we see this already happening in Europe where they’ve just banned transactions, anonymous transactions above 1,000 euro means you have to KYC effect, you’re supposed to KYC all your people you’re transacting with. But obviously this just means that people are going to migrate to anonymous alternatives, because you can’t expect like there’s laws that you cannot enforce.

_**Doug:**_ So do you see the adoption of Monero or whatever, the true digital cash protocol becomes whichever one ends up taking that role on so far, Monero is you know has the lion’s share of all transactions for that use case. But whatever it is, but everyone ends up doing it, do you see that being inevitable that society globally adopts a true digital cash protocol that’s used by essentially everyone citizens around the world? I mean do you see that as kind of an inevitability?

_**Rachel:**_ I don’t think it will be used by everyone. I think at least not in the like short immediate term or even longish term. I think we will have little pockets, zones of freedom popping up. These kind of like as autonomous territories breaking away, but we will also have this like clear net plain text surveillance part existing alongside these autonomous online territories. And so I think we’ll see both, and over time I expect like a people to demonstrate a preference for the autonomous territories over the surveilled ones.

_**Doug:**_ All right. Yeah, we’re obviously the ones that make it happen. Go ahead, you have a question. But I was saying where the you know that’s what Monerotopia is all about, it’s about this idea of opting out of what we’re saying dystopia and into Monerotopia. And that’s really what’s going to determine whether or not Monero or some other form of digital cash succeeds. It’s whether enough people adopt it. Beyond that there’s nothing else that could stop it.

_**Audience:**_ Just a really quick question and a comment, the offer to help Monero migrate to zk-SNARKs or something like it is very interesting, I’m definitely curious to hear more about that, because obviously with the decentralization of Monero funding and driving big migrations like that is a big deal. But along those lines, and if I missed it, because I missed a little bit of the presentation, feel free to brush me off, but why do you view zk-SNARKs or that type of technology as being trustless enough today to implement on a base layer like Monero? I know there’s been just, sorry, a little context, I know there’s been issues in the past with the trusted setup it’s really gotten better and better, but now with I know like I don’t know what the naming is Halo 2 or NewFi or whatever ZCash is calling it these days, there will be no trusted setup, but kind of why do you think now is the time for zk-SNARKs to start taking over?

_**Rachel:**_ Right so it’s to do with the removal of the trusted set up for us. I’m not a cryptographer but the removal of the trusted setup involves like a change to what’s called a polynomial commitment scheme that zk-SNARKs uses. So it actually comes, as far as I know, it comes from Bulletproofs and innovation made by Bulletproofs which Monero is using. And as I said I’m not a cryptographer but Amir Taaki who I work with is and he’s written implementations of all the major zk-algorithms and he understands perfectly the math. So it’s not something you necessarily have to trust right. It’s just, it’s like math. Do you trust math? I think we all do. We’re using it already inside of Monero and also Bitcoin and all over the place…
