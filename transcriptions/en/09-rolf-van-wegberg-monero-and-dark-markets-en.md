_**Doug:**_ Yeah guys, refuel on, coffee if you like, we got plenty of very strong coffee. We’re actually not only brewing fresh coffee, but we’re actually freshly roasting coffee. Coffee that I just brought back from Guatemala for gratuitous. So check it out, it’s kind of funny. You could buy a bag of freshly roasted coffee, which actually is interesting, because that’s kind of the conversation we always have right. Monero’s use cases, and primarily it’s used, you know, for ransomware hackers, on dark markets, that’s where it’s used. And whether or not you ethically agree with those things, it shows a use case, it shows that it’s evidence that it’s functioning as digital cache. So you could even ignore what opinion you have of that, but just from a technology standpoint it means it’s working as intended. And it’s slowly seemingly taking over that use case, which means it’s performing as, you know, the best form of digital cash we currently have. That seems to be the current trend.

But the conversation we always have is, well, you know, there’s other things you could do with Monero, for example, you could buy coffee, and I or you do the gratuitous thing where you can send tips with Monero directly. That’s what you think about this is no way to have done that, but for Monero right. People could be drinking coffee in Brooklyn, gratuitous coffee, and they could send a 50 cent tip, just like taking 50 cents out of their pocket and dropping it in a tip jar. Didn’t go through Venmo, nobody knows it happened, and now it’s in the pocket of a Guatemalan farmer. You just put digital cash around the world. Now that’s an amazing, amazing use case. But without further ado, Ralph, take it away.

_**Ralph:**_ I have mic. Thanks, so maybe now for a completely different story indeed, we’re gonna talk a little bit about use cases. So maybe also to start off a little bit about my background. So I’m an academic, I work in the Netherlands at one of the technical universities there, and my area of research is where cryptocurrencies and darknet markets intersect.

So what I’d like to talk to you about today is work that I’ve been doing together with some colleagues over in Delft, where I’m based, on the relationship between Monero and the story of Monero becoming the most preferred currency to be used on these dark markets. And I don’t know if the person I had this conversation with is in the room right now, but over coffee we had a conversation about “dark markets” is not actually a very neutral term right. So it sort of already gives a certain perspective. So normally what I tend to use is “online anonymous markets”, but that’s sort of like a lot of words to say the same thing. So for today I’m keeping it to “dark market”. And before I get started, and I learned that I need to say “next slide” when I need the next slide right? Okay, cool. I’m going to say that in a bit. Before I get started I want to say, I tried a new format of structuring my talk. So a fellow professor of mine at Delft invented this: “Do your talk in 10 memes format”. I don’t know if this is fun, but I’m going to try to.

So here’s my talk about dark markets and Monero in 10 memes, but before we get started, next slide… no? Oh, thanks. So this is about the story of Monero becoming dark market’s favorite payment option. And I want to take you down memory lane from Silk Road to the White House. Not the actual White House but White House market which is or was one of the most prominent underground markets where Monero was accepted. I want to talk about how vendors, so the people who are selling items on these markets, are incentivized to use it, are incentivized to opt Monero as their favorite payment option. But why and how buyers, so the people who actually transact with them, are dragging their feet. And the third and last point, you know that these markets have administrators right, so the people who are running the market, and I want to talk a little bit about how to create trustworthy admins, so people who can be trusted without an escrow system. So I think everyone here in the room knows what an escrow system is right? So it’s sort of like a notary, where you do not pay directly to the person who sells you an item, let’s say narcotics, but in this case you transact through the market, the market holds back on the cash and then after a while that you say: “Hey, I receive my product”, only then the vendor gets his money. That’s the escrow system. So how do you do that with Monero as a question altogether. So without further ado here comes my talk in 10 memes. Next slide.

So you know Silk Road right? Silk Road was I think the starting point of this underground ecosystem developed by Ross Ulbricht. And I think what has been happening for a while, this was back in 2011-2010, what he did was not per se new right. We’re talking an underground market system, where you could buy all sorts of stuff which you would normally not be buying in a like a normal legal environment. But in this case you would be buying it online. But that was already out there for quite some time. But what changed were two things, and I think you know that, but just to get everyone on the same page, what changed is he invented or not invented but he used the combination of the Tor network, so the site where we’re watching now is a hidden service site right, so it’s on Tor, it’s on a darknet, that’s the first thing, so you can stay anonymous by using the Tor network as an individual using the market, that’s one thing, but the most important other thing was, of course, that he used cryptocurrencies for the first time in combination with a Tor network. So in that case anonymous or pseudonymous payment systems were introduced to this underground economy, where sellers and buyers would interact. And this went from a slow start up until the moment that he was making a tens of thousands of dollars in transactions a day, and how this works is that the administrator, so in this case Ross Ulbricht and his team, took a small fee from every transaction that was going on the market. Funny story by the way is that a lot of people did not know about Silk Road that existed up until the point that the FBI really proudly I must say held a press conference saying: “We took down Silk Road, a market where you can buy all sorts of drugs”. And then people were like: “Hmm is there a market where you can buy all sorts of drugs online? On the darknet? With cryptocurrencies? Awesome”. And then everything took off and this is the story I would like to tell you. Next slide, please.

Okay, so this is 2011 right? So we go a little bit further in time. And you know that these markets are coming and going right, these markets are being targeted by law enforcement. And one of the ways in which law enforcement was able to track, trace but also shut down these markets was the money trail. More specifically the cryptocurrency we just have been talking about. And one of course of the items or the attributes of these markets is that they were using Bitcoin from the start. And slowly they began to realize that that was not per se in their favor. Why? Because, yes, of course, you can use Bitcoins to transact with a drug dealer online, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that you stay anonymous right? Because we notice all the transactions stored in the blockchain, and if information is to be attributed to individuals or personally identifiable information, then law enforcement actually has a better follow the money position, than they would have when you were transacting with the drug dealer on the street corner and you were paying cash right? So the police actually were laughing their balls off that everyone there was still using Bitcoin. Next slide, please.

So then people were like: “Oh my God! Okay, if this is happening, maybe then if I’m running a dark market I may then want to change that payment option or change the payment system, maybe pivot from Bitcoin to Monero?” But of course there was a problem which is a lot of people, and this is you know a market so economic principles apply, the majority of the people who are on these markets only know Bitcoin. Yeah, so this is sort of like the problem of scaling your transactions, or scaling the, yeah scaling the transaction, trying to get as much people involved in this ecosystem. And here of course customers are very important, right? So from a customer perspective you want to have the most or best experience. So these dark markets were trying to on the one hand weigh the well the pseudonymity of Bitcoin against the anonymity of Monero, when it comes to still doing business, right, because if they would opt for Monero only, that would increase privacy but on the other hand might scare away customers. So they went for the middle ground. Next slide, please.

Which is they you know problem solved they just accepted both. Yeah, so that’s what they started out first. And because they were accepting both, we could investigate what then happened, yeah? Or then who is actually willing to pay Monero and who is not, who is actually willing to accept Monero and who is not, and how does the admin, so how does the person who is running this site, make sure that people are incentivized to use Monero instead of Bitcoin, because for the admin it is also more secure, of course, to use Monero than to use Bitcoin. Next slide, please.

So you know the vendors on these markets were like: “Yes, of course, I would love to get paid in Monero. So, you know, please buy everything that I have for sale in Monero, please friends”. But their buyers are like: “So I can pay Monero here? Okay, really? You know, what is that exactly, you know, how do I get my Monero?” That was not, it was not as easy as it was now, or as it is now right? So the problem is that when investigating what buyers and what vendors are incentivized to do, when you look at the legacy vendors, we figured out that about half of these vendors on these markets were actually willing to accept Monero. Yeah, this was in the ins, this was in a time that you could settle between one of the two. So 50 of the vendors were actually willing to accept Monero, which makes sense, because they were looking for more anonymity, because the practices they’re involved in are not always legal. This is an understatement. One slide back, please, yeah. So because those practices are not always legal that means that they were looking for more enhanced features of privacy. So buyers of vendors were actually willing to accept Monero, 50 percent of them, which is a lot because we’re talking 2016-2017, yeah, I’m talking about that time right now. Does anybody have a guess how many buyers, how many percent of buyers were actually willing to pay in Monero. Two percent? It was five. Five percent, yeah. So the problem is that this is not matched up right? So it means that the buyers on these markets are dragging their feet simply because… next slide, please…

Okay, maybe this meme order would have been different anyhow, I made it in the plane order here. Anyhow, so these vendors then were indeed waiting for buyers to pay Monero, because they were advertising their products in Monero, but only one percent of vendors were actually offering their products only to be paid in Monero. Why? Because otherwise they would miss out on a lot of customers. So the status quo was not per se changing. Next slide, please.

Why one does not simply pay in Monero, and why is that, well, this is 2015, 2016, 2017, again — there were not a lot of exchange we could simply go to and buy Monero. Then back then also the wallet system was not as evolved as it is now, meaning that people who are the customers on these platforms, these are the people who make or break certain changes right, these are the people who make and change how we are looking at the customer is at the center of doing business on these markets. And the problem was back then that they were not forced right, they were not forced to pay in Monero. And I guess that you know where this is going, because that is essentially what happened right, because these admins and these vendors were sick and tired of getting, you know, shut down by law enforcement basically because each and everyone could follow the money trail. I also have to add, though that if a market goes down within three or four months a new market emerges, so the market ecosystem is always been stable around about 10 to 12 markets at the same time right? So these market takedowns are a real pain in the ass for the admins. Not per se for the customers right, because the customers would go to another market and just, you know, buy whatever they want to buy. But for the admins and for the vendors it’s a high risk environment, because you know these markets get taken down because people, vendors are willing to accept Monero, but buyers are not paying. Next slide, please.

So the other thing is that for these buyers the following applies which is: I don’t always pay Monero, but when I do it’s on the dark market. This was one of the only things that they would use Monero for. Next slide, please.

And the problem is that they had alternatives right? So these people who are buying or looking to buy drugs could do that on dark markets but also, what we see now, are devoted Telegram channels, and also I think, maybe even Facebook groups etc, where also vendors of illegal narcotics are advertising their products, and you can just pay with you know prepaid debit cards, all sorts of stuff. So there are alternatives there. So instead of trying to compete with getting everything up to the, you know, the nice environment that buyers want, instead of doing that these dark markets made a decision: we’re not going the way of only focusing on these buyers completely, because if we do that might sort of like demolish the whole business model altogether. So what did they do? Next slide, please.

They said: “We want Monero everywhere”. So not giving people any option, not telling them: “Please, you know, pay Monero”, they just scrapped “please”, they said: “Pay in Monero”. Next slide, please.

And that transformed into this market, which is one of the first to do that, who knows this market? Nobody. Interesting. Oh, I have one hand, okay. If you’re afraid to tell me, it’s also fine, you can approach me after. This is the White House Market, it doesn’t exist anymore, it didn’t get shut down by law enforcement, they quit, they say voluntarily. But this was the first market, yeah, it’s, I think, it’s not really well readable in the back but it says, top right, it says: XMR, so it’s my Monero balance. This is my screenshot I took myself by the way. It is very technically advanced. So it’s not only that you can only pay with Monero, it’s also the case that there is two-factor authentication with a PGP key, so what they did is they stepped up, they stepped up across the board, So it’s not only “you cannot pay with Bitcoin anymore”, it’s also you have to register an account with two-factor authentication. So they amped up security. So they’re not competing anymore, they’re not competing on ease of use completely, they’re competing on security, they’re competing on privacy, and they’re competing on stealth right. So stealth as in you get packages delivered with illegal narcotics that are not per se very well detectable, whereas the other alternative I just showed, that the Telegram channels that’s really out in the open, everyone can see those telegram channels, you can pay with prepaid debit cards, they are competing on customer experience. They’re not competing on privacy, security or any other thoughts that are more on a professional level. So this is the story of why Monero became the most preferred payment option on dark markets. So it’s not per se the community who, and then community I mean buyers, because that is a bigger community that decided to push for this shift. Vendors signaled they would like to push for this shift, but in the end it turned out to be the admins that are the real changing, or that there was a real game changer that they shifted to Monero completely.

But then comes the question in an anonymous environment where you normally have this escrow system. How do you do that? Because an escrow system really only works whenever you have multisig wallets right, because if you don’t the middleman, in this case the market, can just run off with all your money right, because if you as a buyer or a vendor have no control of who is actually keeping your funds they might run off with your money. And this is a still a bottleneck as in to my knowledge there is no nice GUI interface that you can use to do multisig with Monero in a system like this. So that is still a challenge to be solved, but what these markets have been doing is pushing the boundaries of security and privacy coming together on these types of markets. Next slide, please.

So this was what I would like to tell about the work that I’ve been doing with some colleagues in Delft to you, and I’ll be happy to take any questions you might have. Thank you.

_[Applause]_

There’s a question in the back, I don’t know if there’s a microphone somewhere. I hope that the 10 meme thing was it was nice, okay, thanks. One person is clapping, it’s nice.

_**Audience:**_ So quick question for you. This week obviously there was a huge, huge shake up in the darknet market world with Hydra being taken down, which was also really the last large Bitcoin only darknet market. How do you see that shaking up the adoption of Monero and darknet markets overall?

_**Ralph:**_ I think it’s… a very good question by the way, thanks. I think that was still a bit legacy, to be fair. That market started maybe 10 years ago. So it had a really long lifespan that you normally don’t see. Partly due to the fact that they were focusing on the Russian and the old Soviet state market. And actually only now, because of these sanctions in place with the war between Ukraine and Russia going on, only now they had enough legal power to actually shut down the market. Otherwise it would have run for years, is my guess. But yeah, to answer your question, I think it’s not going to change, it’s more like that was the old one out, still running Bitcoin solely, and I think the default, the standard has now become Monero only marketplaces.

_**Audience:**_ Thank you.

_**Ralph:**_ You’re welcome. Any other questions? Oh yeah. […] I was actually trying to get the meme tips, but this is nice, yeah. Okay, okay, yeah. Apparently the format is doing 10 memes you’re doing a talk in 10 memes, otherwise it would have had 20, but that’s sort of like, yeah, I don’t know. Any other questions?

_**Audience:**_ So a question at the back.

_**Ralph:**_ Oh yeah, sorry I didn’t see you.

_**Audience:**_ That’s okay. So you talked about darknet markets as like broad marketplaces, eBay style. I’d imagine some of the vendors have got frustrated with the exits over time, whether or not it’s exit scam or whether it’s voluntary. Has there been much of a shift towards vendors setting up their own marketplace or sites I guess or is that still going on?

_**Ralph:**_ No, no, no. Very good question. Yes that was going on for quite a bit. The problem is this is also about the economies of scale. So if you are a brand which is not being able to attract as many customers as you would, if you would be on eBay, Amazon, this is sort of the same like your neighborhood grocery store versus a store that is connected with either eBay or Amazon. That has more attraction. So unless you have a very good brand by yourself, and you may be in a niche, then it might be worthwhile to go that way. But then comes the other part of the equation, which is how do you secure your reputation in an anonymous setting without a third party acting as a middleman right? So there is no marketplace, you are the vendor and the marketplace at the same time, so you can’t do escrow, you can’t do stuff like this right, because you are two parties in a three-party system. And that does not work completely or doesn’t work like it should do. So there are stores that are, you know, what we call a “single vendor store”. So there’s only one vendor running one store. But it’s not the default. The default is still these big markets, and not per se because that’s the best option, but economies of scale just make sure that is still the most preferred solution.

_**Audience:**_ Just one quick follow-up to that. So you mentioned that a lot of these markets or the markets that we’re using Monero, we’re not using multisig. How much of a hindrance is that in the dot net space that?

_**Ralph:**_ A big hindrance. But I mean if these admins are, you know, teaming up and are saying, I’m not perceived teaming up because they don’t know each other, I guess, but I mean like teaming up in the sense of that they’re all raising the part to a certain level and are not lowering the bar anymore. So the downside is that multisig doesn’t support, so they’re still running escrow but without multisig, which is more dangerous right, because the marketplace then really controls the funds, all completely by its own and not in a shared environment. But I guess the ecosystem is okay with that, given the side effects of using Bitcoin. Not having multisig outweighs using or still pivoting back to Bitcoin right.

_**Audience:**_ Yeah, thank you.

_**Ralph:**_ You’re welcome. Maybe your last question, I don’t know how we are in time. Oh, yeah, there’s one question right there.

_**Audience:**_ So I’m still pretty new to Monero and I was just wondering, you know, based on your talk since this is such a common use case for Monero, what do you anticipate like law enforcement once they catch on to Monero, like what in the future maybe like what kind of actions legislators or policy makers could try to take to come at this particular use case?

_**Ralph:**_ Yeah, that’s a good question. I think there are multiple ways in which to approach this problem, if you can define it as a problem, but I think law enforcement does of course. There’s the Money Avenue right, so and that’s what they did in the past like follow the money approaches using Bitcoin. There’s of course something else, which is that these technical infrastructures are not maintained by Amazon and eBay right, they’re maintained by so-called professionals, but of course they’re not as professional as the Amazon or eBay tech staff, which means that they’re also, that they make mistakes in configuring these websites. So that’s the other avenue or route of exploitation that law enforcement takes to take down these websites. So then maybe the way to use or the advantage, they might have had with Bitcoin following the money around, might disappear with people pivoting to Monero. But on the other hand these technical mishaps in configuration still happen, so that means that they have still plenty of opportunities to go after these markets if they please.

_**Audience:**_ But that’s with the markets itself, not with actually Monero, because Monero, there’s really no way that they can…

_**Ralph:**_ Not that I see currently right now. But I mean like from a more regulatory standpoint of course there are places in the ecosystem right, so where Monero gets transacted or gets exchanged for another currency, that can be fiat currency, but it can also be another cryptocurrency, those are places that law enforcement can of course try to regulate certain aspects of doing business in that area. But I mean those are in its early stages, those regulatory options, yeah. So I don’t know if this answers your question, but…

_**Audience:**_ Thank you.

_**Ralph:**_ You’re welcome. Going once, going twice. Thanks everyone.

_[Applause]_
